## Creating an online home

As a coder as codeX the internet will be your home away from home, it’s where you will learn and learn to learn. If you don’t know something don’t fear: the internet is your friend. If you know something, the internet is your friend as well as you can easily tell others what you know and learn. This journey of discovery and sharing will be an integral part of your codeX journey. If anything of the things below make no sense - write it down on a post-it note then google it, or wave a mentor closer to talk it through.

So let’s get going.
