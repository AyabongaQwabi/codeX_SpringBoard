#codeX SpringBoard

Let's get going with Codex it will be an adventure and a challenge, but never boring.

## Creating an online home

As a coder as codeX the internet will be your home away from home, it’s where you will learn and learn to learn. If you don’t know something don’t fear: the internet is near. 

If you don't know something, the internet is your friend and it's a great place to share with others what you know and learn. This journey of discovery and sharing will be an integral part of your codeX journey. 

If anything of the things below make no sense - follow the codeX learning cycle:
 * Write it down on a post-it note - keep these close to you and we will review them regularly.
 * Then google it 
 * If still in doubt wave a mentor closer to talk it through
 
So let’s get going.
