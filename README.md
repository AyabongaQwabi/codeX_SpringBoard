# Creating an online home

As a coder as codeX the internet will be your home away from home, it’s where you will learn and learn to learn. If you don’t know something don’t fear: the internet is your friend. If you know something, the internet is your friend as well as you can easily tell others what you know and learn. This journey of discovery and sharing will be an integral part of your codeX journey. If anything of the things below make no sense - write it down on a post-it note then google it, or wave a mentor closer to talk it through.

So let’s get going.

Create my codeX home

You need an online presence and we will start simple. Create a page that is all about you, who are you, where do you live, what did you achieve, what do you want to achieve and learn at codeX - anything that you think is interesting - your favourite quote etc.

Use HTML and CSS to make is display nicely in a web page - call it index.html, create a folder called myCodexHome. Add this folder to github.com.

One this is done publish it online for the whole world to see it… now market it using twitter/facebook

After tapping yourself on the back let’s move on.

Let’s face it you will learn new things at codeX on a daily if not hourly basis. You need a way of sharing these new insights to the world. That’s exactly what blogs are for - there are various different kind of blogging sight out there - Wordpress is a good one you could check out. But you will not be using any of those online blogs.

You will create your own one…
