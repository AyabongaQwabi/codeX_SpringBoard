#A more dynamic blog

What is all this all this static html files all about you ask? How on earth am I suppose to blog from your cellphone? Have you ever tried to create an html file from your phone? If so, good for you!

Let’s change this… Now create a dynamic blog instead of blogging directly in HTML files lets create blog entries using a HTML Form. 

The form should allow me to add a heading for my blog post and a place to write my blog post. Once done writing your post you should be able to press a button that store your blog post and it should take you to the home screen which list all the posts.

For starters store your blog posts locally in the browser using Javascript & JQuery (using HTML5’s localStorage support ) Figure out how to see the entries in the localStorage using Chrome & Firefox. You will need to figure out how to loop through entries stored in localStorage and store display them on screen. If you

Ok let’s stand back and take a look at what you should have by now. Your new dynamic blog started out blank,  just with an Add Blog Entry button. After clicking that button a few times and adding some Blog entries your blogs home page should contain a few blog entries. These entries are very caged in they only live in your browser - you were using localStorage after all. But the benefit is that you can write blog entries when you are not connected to the internet. That’s localStorage for you.

After doing a bit of a victory dance let the world know what you are up to, I am afraid you will have to use your old static blog for this still as your new dynamic blog got no global conscience yet. Tell your audience to be patient and to stay tuned.
