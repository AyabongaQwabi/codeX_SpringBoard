#Create a static blog

Create a folder called blog in your myCodexHome folder called index.html.

Write 2 blog posts on your blog, what did you learn so far & what are you excited about - again you decide. 
Create 2 separate html files for each blog post. call them post1.html/post2.html for  example. 
Your blog post should have a heading and some content.

Going to the index.html page one should be able to see all the blog posts in your blog.  
If you really want to be smart add an rss.xml file, use this for an RSS feed for your blog.

Commit all of things into github and deploy this online. 
Your blog should be online at: http://coders/projectcodex.co/<your_name>/blog

As always spread the word on Social media.

Before you do anything. 
Make 100% sure that all your code is committed in github - mark your old code by creating a branch in GIT called 
first_blog. Make sure this is commited and safely tucked away in github.
