#Create a static blog

Create a folder called blog in your myCodexHome folder called index.html.

Write at least 3 blog posts on your blog:
* An entry on why you are at codeX. What are your expectations, what makes you excited about codeX.
* An post with a photo of you at your codeX laptop - why not add a photo with your fellow codeXers.
* Another entry in which you tell what you have learned so far at codeX.

 
Create 2 separate html files for each blog post. Call them post1.html/post2.html/post3.html for example. 
Your blog post should have a heading in bold text and some content with a few paragraphs some headers, add at least one photo to your blog post and whatever else that will make your posts intersting

Going to the index.html page one should be able to see all the blog posts in your blog.  
If you really want to be smart add an rss.xml file, use this for an RSS feed for your blog. Don't forget to use some CSS to style your blog to your liking

Commit all of things into github into a new project and deploy this online. 

Your blog should be online at: ```http://coders.projectcodex.co/<your_name>/blog```

As always spread the word on Social media.

Before you do anything. 

> Make 100% sure that all your code is committed in github - mark your code by creating a branch in GIT called first_blog. Make sure this is commited and safely tucked away in github.
