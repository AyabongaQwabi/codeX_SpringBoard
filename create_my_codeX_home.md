# Create my codeX home

You need an online presence and we will start simple. Create a page that is all about you, who are you, where do you live, what did you achieve, what do you want to achieve and learn at codeX - anything that you think is interesting - your favourite quote etc. Use HTML and CSS to make it display nicely in a web page, call it index.html.

Fork the github repository below into your own github profile: ```https://github.com/codex-academy/codeX_coders```

Now get a local copy of this repository. Using this command:
```git clone https://github.com/<your_github_usernmae>/codeX_coders```

This will create a local copy of the repository in a folder called ```codeX_coders```. In this folder create a folder that is your name - this folder name will be part of the URL where your webpage will be published online. The index.html file describe above should be created in this folder. Once you are done commit you code into your github repository.

Once this is done publish it online for the whole world to see it… now market it using twitter/facebook

Steps to follow:

      * Fork the codeX_coders repo
      * Create folder with your name in the cloned folder
      * Create your index.html file in the folder above
      * Commit and push this into you github repo - see the changes reflected online
      * Once done to a pull request to the central repo ```https://github.com/codex-academy/codeX_coders``` - once done speak to the mentor to accept your request to get it displayed on line
      * You can do test pull requests if you want to understand the process better


After tapping yourself on the back let’s move on.

Let’s face it you will learn new things at codeX on a daily if not hourly basis. You need a way of sharing these new insights to the world. That’s exactly what blogs are for - there are various different kind of blogging sight out there - Wordpress is a good one you could check out. But you will not be using any of those online blogs.

You will create your own one…
