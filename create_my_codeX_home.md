# Create my codeX home

You need an online presence and we will start simple. Create a page that is all about you, who are you, where do you live, what did you achieve, what do you want to achieve and learn at codeX - anything that you think is interesting - your favourite quote etc.

Use HTML and CSS to make is display nicely in a web page - call it index.html, create a folder called mycodeXhome. Add this folder to github.com.

One this is done publish it online for the whole world to see it… now market it using twitter/facebook

After tapping yourself on the back let’s move on.

Let’s face it you will learn new things at codeX on a daily if not hourly basis. You need a way of sharing these new insights to the world. That’s exactly what blogs are for - there are various different kind of blogging sight out there - Wordpress is a good one you could check out. But you will not be using any of those online blogs.

You will create your own one…
