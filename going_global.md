#Going global

At this stage you might want to look into HTML POST and GET requests, thereâ€™s more where these two are coming from this but those two will serve you well for now.

We built a REST API (yes go and google!)for your blog posts, this will help you a lot to store and share your blog posts with the world.

There are 3 parts to the API:


Desciption    | URL         | Http Verb
--------------|-------------|----------
Get all posts | api.projectcodex.co/blog/<user_name> | GET
Create a new entry for a specific user | api.projectcodex.co/blog/<user_name> | POST
Get a specific blog post | api.projectcodex.co/blog/<user_name> | GET

This will help you to store your posts online - go and try it out by opening this URL in a browser: 

http://api.projectcodex.co/blog/andre

> Tip: at this stage understanding more about JQuery Ajax support will serve you well. Go and speak to google and your fellow codeXers about his. Ajax is not a washing powder brand or a football club by the way. We are interested in GET and POST http verbs

Now start using your newly found Ajax knowledge.

Change your blogs home page to display all the blog posts from this URL: http://api.projectcodex.co/blog/andre 

Start creating blog posts under your own name using this url:
```http://api.projectcodex.co/blog/<user_name>/post```

>Remember to put your name in the place of <user_name>

Once you created a few test blog posts look at them using this URL: ```http://api.projectcodex.co/blog/<user_name>```

Change your blog home page now to display your own blog posts.

Use the this url to look at a specific blog post: ```http://api.projectcodex.co/blog/<user_name>/post/<post_id>```
